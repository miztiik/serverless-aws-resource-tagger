# Automatically TAG AWS Resources
This is an automatic tagging solution for AWS Resources. Automatically tagging resources can greatly improve the ease of cost allocation and governance.


## How
Tag sources are picked up from a S3 Bucket and applied to targeted resources. Apply Global enterprise wide tags or application specific tags, with the use of specific files.
